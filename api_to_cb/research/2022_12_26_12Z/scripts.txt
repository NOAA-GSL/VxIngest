The following scripts on emb-prod-verif.gsd.esrl.noaa.gov handle the loading of 
RAOBs from Mark's site into our ruc_ua database:

/w3/emb/rucsoundings/java/latest_raobs_db.pl
This one handles the call to the CGI script that interacts with Mark's database.
It updates metadata on the ruc_ua side, but does not actually handle the loading of the obs there.
The next script does.

/home/amb-verif/ruc_uaverif/load_raobs2.pl
This is the script that does the heavy lifting of calling Mark's database and grabbing the actual
sounding output and manipulating it to get the output we need. Unfortunately,
it is fairly messy code and there are many calls underneath this main script,
including java programs that do most of the work.
