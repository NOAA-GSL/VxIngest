# Decisions

This part of our documentation records decisions we have made for the VxIngest project. We've chosen to:

- Use the Architecture/Any Decision Record format for this purpose
- Make a distinction between "architecture" and "scientific" decision records
  - Architecture decisions are decisions focused on software & infrastructure patterns & use.
  - Scientific decisions are decisions focused on how to calculate & handle data

This is largely inspired by the work done in the beta.weather.gov rewrite. You can [see their usage of ADRs in their GitHub repo here](https://github.com/weather-gov/weather.gov/tree/main/docs/architecture/decisions)
