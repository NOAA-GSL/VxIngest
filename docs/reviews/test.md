# Testing

## Unit tests

## Integration tests

## Test data

The tests will be a combination of unit and integration tests. The unit tests should cover the handlers and utility methods.
The integration tests will be patterned after the existing GribBuilder integration tests.
The test data file will be the 00Z July32, 20024 Grib File.
For the two thread integration test I'll choose another of those Gib files as well.

The test also needs to test downloading the test data from the NODD and removing the temporary file.
