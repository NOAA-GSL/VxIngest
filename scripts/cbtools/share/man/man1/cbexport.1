.SH "COLLECTION AWARE EXPORTS"
.sp
The default behavior of export for the cluster versions which support
collections is to export all available scopes/collections in a bucket.
.SH "DISCUSSION"
.sp
The cbexport command is used to export data from Couchbase to various different
formats. Each supported export format is a subcommand of the cbexport utility.
.SH "OPERATIONS DURING MAJOR CLUSTER CONFIGURATION CHANGES"
.sp
Operations (commands or sub\-commands) which connect to a cluster are not
supported during major cluster configuration changes.
.sp
For example, performing an import/export, making a backup or performing a
restore whilst changing the TLS configuration/security settings is unsupported.
.sp
These types of changes (e.g. changing the TLS mode to strict) are not expected
to be time consuming so it\(cqs generally expected that operations should be
started after completing the configuration change.
.sp
Please note that this does not include rebalances; operations may be performed
during a rebalance. The reason for this distinction, is that major cluster
configuration changes are generally quick, whilst rebalances for large data
sets may be time consuming.
.SH "FURTHER DOCUMENTATION"
.sp
A manual page is available for each of the supported sources listed above.
