cbbackupmgr-strategies \- Recommended backup strategies for cbbackupmgr
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Backing up data is an important part of any production database deployment. In
this section we will go through the most common cbbackupmgr backup strategies
and also provide recommendations for how and where to run cbbackupmgr. To
describe each strategy we will assume that users will want to back up their
cluster daily, but all strategies can be easily modified to accommodate
different backup intervals.
.sp
In the strategies below we will refer to taking a full backup even though
cbbackupmgr is an incremental\-only tool. When this term is used we are referring
to the first backup taken in a backup repository.
.SH "PERIODIC MERGE"
.sp
The recommended backup strategy for cbbackupmgr is the Periodic Merge strategy.
This backup strategy is intended to have the lowest cluster overhead and will
require the least amount of time. The periodic merge strategy takes full
advantage the fact that cbbackupmgr only takes incremental backups as well as
its ability to merge incremental backup. In a Periodic Merge strategy we would
take an incremental backup each day as follows:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
Sunday:    Config Backup Repo    (0 backups in backup repo)
Sunday:    Backup 1              (1 backup in backup repo)
Monday:    Backup 2              (2 backups in backup repo)
Tuesday:   Backup 3              (3 backups in backup repo)
Wednesday: Backup 4              (4 backups in backup repo)
Thursday:  Backup 5              (5 backups in backup repo)
Friday:    Backup 6              (6 backups in backup repo)
Saturday:  Backup 7              (7 backups in backup repo)
Sunday:    Backup 8              (8 backups in backup repo)
Sunday:    Merge 1\-7             (2 backups in backup repo)
Monday:    Backup 9              (3 backups in backup repo)
Tuesday:   Backup 10             (4 backups in backup repo)
Wednesday: Backup 11             (5 backups in backup repo)
Thursday:  Backup 12             (6 backups in backup repo)
Friday:    Backup 13             (7 backups in backup repo)
Saturday:  Backup 14             (8 backups in backup repo)
Sunday:    Backup 15             (9 backups in backup repo)
Sunday:    Merge 7\-14            (2 backups in backup repo)
.fam

.if n .RE
.sp
Each day we increase the amount of incremental backups in the backup repository,
but in order to reclaim space we merge the incremental backups from the previous
week on Sundays in order to reclaim space. This strategy is effective because
incremental backups are the quickest way to back up a cluster and when we need
to consolidate the data we can do so without using any cluster resource. This
strategy is useful because as data grows it may become infeasible to back up the
entire cluster in a reasonable amount of time. By always taking incremental
backups and merging at a later time, we can completely avoid full cluster
backups.
.SH "FULL/INCREMENTAL APPROACH"
.sp
The Full/Incremental Approach is similar to the Periodic Merge strategy, but
has one key difference. Instead of relying on the merge feature to merge backups
together we create a new backup repository periodically and back up the entire
cluster again. We then take incremental backups daily. Below is an example of
what this strategy would look like:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
Sunday:    Config Backup Repo 1  (0 backups in backup repo)
Sunday:    Backup 1              (1 backup in backup repo)
Monday:    Backup 2              (2 backups in backup repo)
Tuesday:   Backup 3              (3 backups in backup repo)
Wednesday: Backup 4              (4 backups in backup repo)
Thursday:  Backup 5              (5 backups in backup repo)
Friday:    Backup 6              (6 backups in backup repo)
Saturday:  Backup 7              (7 backups in backup repo)
Sunday:    Config Backup Repo 2  (0 backup in backup repo)
Sunday:    Backup 8              (1 backups in backup repo)
Monday:    Backup 9              (2 backups in backup repo)
Tuesday:   Backup 10             (3 backups in backup repo)
Wednesday: Backup 11             (4 backups in backup repo)
Thursday:  Backup 12             (5 backups in backup repo)
Friday:    Backup 13             (6 backups in backup repo)
Saturday:  Backup 14             (7 backups in backup repo)
Sunday:    Create Backup Repo 3  (0 backups in backup repo)
Sunday:    Backup 15             (1 backup in backup repo)
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
In this strategy we don\(cqt use the merge command, but instead rely on creating a
new backup repository each week on Sunday. In order to free up space in this
strategy we would delete old backup repositories once they are deemed to be too
old to be useful. This strategy is useful for small to medium sized clusters due
to the requirement to take full backups.
.SH "FULL BACKUP ONLY"
.sp
In this strategy we only take full backups. This strategy is only useful for
small clusters and puts the most strain on the cluster compared to other
strategies. A backup strategy using only full backups would look like this:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
Sunday:    Config Backup Repo 1  (0 backups in backup repo)
Sunday:    Backup 1              (1 backup in backup repo)
Monday:    Config Backup Repo 2  (0 backups in backup repo)
Monday:    Backup 2              (1 backup in backup repo)
Tuesday:   Config Backup Repo 3  (0 backups in backup repo)
Tuesday:   Backup 3              (1 backup in backup repo)
Wednesday: Config Backup Repo 4  (0 backups in backup repo)
Wednesday: Backup 4              (1 backup in backup repo)
Thursday:  Config Backup Repo 5  (0 backups in backup repo)
Thursday:  Backup 5              (1 backup in backup repo)
Friday:    Config Backup Repo 6  (0 backups in backup repo)
Friday:    Backup 6              (1 backup in backup repo)
Saturday:  Config Backup Repo 7  (0 backups in backup repo)
Saturday:  Backup 7              (1 backup in backup repo)
Sunday:    Config Backup Repo 8  (0 backups in backup repo)
Sunday:    Backup 8              (1 backup in backup repo)
