        Experimental Couchbase tests
        ✓ Establish CouchBase connection (1 ms)
        ✓ Test: Get data for 3 named stations (5090 ms)
        ✓ Test: Get data for N named stations (7220 ms)
        ✓ Test: Get data for all named stations (301375 ms)
        Non-linear, since N above is about 60, so we go from: 1500 ms for 3 => 120 ms (for 60) => 50 ms (for 6000)
